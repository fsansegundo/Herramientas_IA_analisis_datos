## Two applications of AI in Data Analysis

+ Use AI assistants to **write code** for Data Analysis  
(or any other coding task $\to$ broader audience).

+ Use AI to **actually do Data Analysis.**

We will focus on the first, but we will also give some hints about the second.


## AI assistants to write code for Data Analysis

Focus on two assistants:

+ **Google's Gemini** via Colab. To use **Colab** and Gemini all you need is a Google account.   

+ **GitHub's Copilot**. We will provide access instructions below. 

## Example with Google Gemini

+ Our goal in this example is to illustrate the use of AI code assistants such as Google's Gemini or GitHub Copilot in any task involving code writing. We will use a data analysis problem as an example, but the same general ideas apply to many other situations.

+ The following link (Google account required) opens up a [Colab notebook for this example](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZOO9aHIWUMSmeZbf_G8bj2-2LixYzhcE/view?usp=sharing). **When the link opens, click on the button on top.** 

+ There is also an static version of a previous run of the notebook that [you can find here](https://fsansegundo.github.io/Herramientas_IA_analisis_datos/EDA_with_gemini_V1.html)

## Rerunning the example with GitHub Copilot and VS Code

+ The same example using GitHub Copilot in VS Code can be found in the GitHub repo for this session.

+ We have also created a (static snapshot) [html version of the notebook](EDA_with_copilot.html) that you can inspect in a web browser.

+ To try it you need Python and  a virtual environment, **highly recommended**. The [CONDA_SETUP.html](CONDA_SETUP.html) file provides some extra information. **Talk to someone experienced if you are not!**

+ For new Copilot users: [Video recommendation](https://youtu.be/2q0BoioYSxQ) 

## How to get access to Copilot through GitHub Education

+ First you need a (free) [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) **using the University email**.
+ For academic users (students & teachers) [this link]( https://docs.github.com/en/education/about-github-education/github-education-for-teachers/apply-to-github-education-as-a-teacher) shows how to get a (free) GitHub Education account, that includes Copilot. Also look [here](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/manage-your-account/getting-free-access-to-copilot-pro-as-a-student-teacher-or-maintainer).
+ The recommended way to use it is with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). Once you have VS Code installed you can follow [these instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/setup#_set-up-copilot-in-vs-code). 

## Uses of AI to *actually do* Data Analysis

+ LLMs are particularly well-suited for tasks involving NLP: sentiment analysis, text classification, summarization, and question-answering.

+ [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction) offers a [Python library](https://platform.openai.com/docs/libraries/python-library?language=python) that can be used for that. **Not free!** You pay per tokens read and generated (0.02€ for the example below).

+ To do this we create a *prompt template* and programatically use it with our data. For sentiment analysis (*positive/negative*) we create a prompt for each text in the dataset. See an example notebook here (for VS code): [OpenAI_API_example.html](OpenAI_API_example.html).


## Hugging Face.

+ [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co) is a company and open-source community best known for the *Transformers Python Library*, with > 1.8M pre-trained models. See the References section.

+ [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) is a platform that allows hosting and sharing model demos and applications.

+ This [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/fsansegundo/Herramientas_IA_analisis_datos/blob/main/HuggingFace_Example.ipynb) contains a very basic example using some models via Hugging Face.

+ Trummer's book introduces LangChain and Llama-Index frameworks to build complex multi-step data analysis pipelines.
